# wedding
is frontend, responsive and static web project made with html, css and javascript
it is an invitation card for a wedding

# How to use
### In the link add this: 
```?name=Abdo%20Tolba```
as `%20` represnts space
### How it works?
The web page has 2 condtions depening on the value of a virable `name`
if it is equal to null thin there is no value for whom you invited to the wedding so the invitation card will be genrall in it's context
the seconed state if the name is site to any value, in thi case the invitation transfers to the context of inviting only one person
